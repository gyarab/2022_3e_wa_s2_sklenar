                of
                Grigori and Shuri Himejima, a member of the Himejima Clan. She is Rias Gremory's Queen as well as her

                <li>
                    Elemental Demonic Power: Akeno excels in using natural elements such as lightning, ice, fire, and
                    water. She
                    is able to create thunder clouds using her demonic power, making lightning bolts rain down on her
                    opponents.
                    She could freeze Cerberus' flames in an instant and target ice spears at her opponents. In Volume
                    14, much
                    like her Holy Lightning Dragon, Akeno can also form Asian Dragon made out of fire and ice, sending
                    them at
                    her enemies;
                </li>
                <li>
                    Defensive Magic: She has been shown to be able to use magic to strengthen the power of her defense
                    by
                    focusing on the Rook trait of her Queen piece, to protect herself as well as others from powerful
                    attacks.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Teleportation: Akeno has demonstrated the ability to teleport herself and others.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Hypnosis: Akeno has shown the ability to hypnotize others as she used it on her college friends to
                    keep
                    Issei's identity a secret while introducing him as her boyfriend.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Cloth Manipulation: Usually when Akeno needs to use all of her magic power, she alters her clothes
                    into a
                    Shinto priestess attire that gave her the epithet, "Priestess of Thunder". She also uses this to
                    repair
                    hers or the clothes of others.
