        Akeno Himejima is a first-year college student at Kuoh Academy and one of the many female protagonists of High
        School DxD. She is the daughter of Baraqiel, a Fallen Angel Cadre, who is the current Vice Governor General of
        Grigori and Shuri Himejima, a member of the Himejima Clan. She is Rias Gremory's Queen as well as her best

    <p>
        Akeno is a beautiful young woman with a voluptuous figure, very long black hair and violet eyes. Her hair is
        usually tied in a long ponytail, reaching all the way down to her legs with two strands sticking out from the
        top and sloping backward, with an orange ribbon keeping it in place.
    </p>
    <p>
        Like most of the girls at Kuoh Academy, she wears the customary Kuoh Academy girls' school uniform, along with
        black calf-length socks.
    </p>
    <p>
        As revealed in the visual book with her data, her body measurements are [B102-W60-H89 cm] [B40-W24-H35 in]. Her
        body weight is [54 kg] [119 lbs] while her height is 168 cm (5 feet 6 inches).

            Elemental Demonic Power: Akeno excels in using natural elements such as lightning, ice, fire, and water. She
            is able to create thunder clouds using her demonic power, making lightning bolts rain down on her opponents.
            She could freeze Cerberus' flames in an instant and target ice spears at her opponents. In Volume 14, much
            like her Holy Lightning Dragon, Akeno can also form Asian Dragon made out of fire and ice, sending them at
            her enemies;
        </li>
        <li>
            Defensive Magic: She has been shown to be able to use magic to strengthen the power of her defense by
            focusing on the Rook trait of her Queen piece, to protect herself as well as others from powerful attacks.
        </li>
        <li>
            Teleportation: Akeno has demonstrated the ability to teleport herself and others.
        </li>
        <li>
            Hypnosis: Akeno has shown the ability to hypnotize others as she used it on her college friends to keep
            Issei's identity a secret while introducing him as her boyfriend.
        </li>
        <li>
            Cloth Manipulation: Usually when Akeno needs to use all of her magic power, she alters her clothes into a
            Shinto priestess attire that gave her the epithet, "Priestess of Thunder". She also uses this to repair
            hers or the clothes of others.
